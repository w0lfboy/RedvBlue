# RedvBlue
Assessment, Analysis,  and Hardening of a Vulnerable System

## Overview and Objectives
- The first objective of this project was to expose vulnerabilities on the victim machine, Capstone VM, using our attacking machine, Kali VM,  while monitoring our attack on a separate ELK VM.
- The second objective of this project was to see what activity was actually picked up by our monitoring machine (ELK).
- The third objective of this project was to see how we can mitigate the vulnerabilities by hardening the system and/or creating an alert system that notifies the security team when the system is breached.
- **Tools used**: netdiscover, nmap, Metasploit, MSFVenom, hydra, Kibana, meterpreter, cadaver, Linux, Windows
